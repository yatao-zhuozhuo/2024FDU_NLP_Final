Jared, in this scenario, has a degree which significantly impacts his potential earnings.\\n\\n1. Given that the pay for a diploma holder is stated to be $4000 per month, we can first establish the baseline salary for diploma holders, which is $4000.\\n\\n2. Since Jared holds a degree, we can calculate his monthly earnings by using the fact that he earns three times what a diploma holder makes. Therefore, we perform the calculation as follows: \\n\\n   Degree salary per month = 3 * Salary of diploma holder\\n   This translates to: 3 * $4000 = $<<4000*3=12000>>12000. \\n   Hence, Jared earns $12000 every month.\\n\\n3. Now that we have determined Jared's monthly salary, we want to find out what his total earnings would be for an entire year. Knowing there are 12 months in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by the number of months: \\n\\n   Total yearly earnings = Monthly salary * 12\\n   Therefore, this gives us: 12 * $12000 = $<<12*12000=144000>>144000. \\n   Thus, Jared will earn a total of $144000 in one year.\\n\\nThrough this systematic assessment of Jared's earnings based on his educational qualifications, we can conclude that his annual income is indeed substantial, given his degree status. \\n\\n#### 144000\"}"
